# AI Interaction Guidelines

## Before Generating Complex Code

1. User must provide `.ai/ai-context.md` content
2. Ask if research phase is complete
3. Ask if plan is validated
4. Confirm user can explain architectural decisions

## During Generation

- Follow provided plan exactly
- Stop and ask if ambiguous
- Reference ai-context.md for patterns to follow/avoid
- Flag when deviating from architectural principles
- Always attempt to install dependencies instead of adding to config files.

## After Generation

- Remind user to validate against post-generation checklist
- Suggest what should be added to ai-context.md if new patterns emerged

## Guardrails Reference

For detailed checklists and safeguards, see `.ai/ai-guardrails.md`:

- Pre-generation checklist (validate before implementation)
- Post-generation checklist (validate after implementation)
- Stop and think triggers (red-light scenarios)

### `.ai/archive/`

**Purpose:** Store completed research/plan docs  
**Naming:** `research-[task]-YYYYMMDD.md`, `plan-[task]-YYYYMMDD.md`  
**When:** Move here after task complete and learnings extracted
