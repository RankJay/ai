## Components Involved

- `[file path]`: [purpose and role]
- `[file path]`: [purpose and role]

## Dependencies Mapped

- [Component A] → [Component B]: [relationship]
- [Component B] → [Component C]: [relationship]

## Current Implementation Analysis

[How it works now - describe the current state]

## Essential vs Accidental Complexity

**Essential (inherent to problem):**

- [What's fundamental to solving this]

**Accidental (from our solution):**

- [Legacy patterns, technical debt]
- [Patterns to avoid preserving]

## Constraints Discovered

- [What must not break]
- [What must remain compatible]
- [Performance/security requirements]

## Edge Cases Found

- [Edge case 1]: [how currently handled]
- [Edge case 2]: [how currently handled]

## Risk Areas

- **High Blast Radius**: [components that affect many others]
- **Security Sensitive**: [auth, payment, data handling]
- **Performance Critical**: [hot paths]

## Open Questions

- [Question needing clarification]
- [Uncertainty to resolve]

## Recommended Next Steps
